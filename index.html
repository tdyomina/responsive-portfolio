          <h2>Frontend Developer from Europe</h2>
          <p>
            Hello to everyone! I'm Looking for my first job in IT, I decided to
            go with web development, since I understand that it is impossible to
            succeed in almost any business without some online presence. Hence I
            know the opportunities are there and will stay there. But I am not
            one who would opt for freelancing, since I do not enjoy that part of
            the job–looking for clients, doing marketing, keeping books. I
            simply enjoy working on the code, developing beautiful websites, and
            that’s why I apply for this job with you. To my greatest hobbies
            belong tourism, and cooking.
          </p>
